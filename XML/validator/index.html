#"Well Formed" XML document#
An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".
The syntax rules were described in the previous chapters:
	XML documents must have a root element
	XML elements must have a closing tag
	XML tags are case sensitive
	XML elements must be properly nested
	XML attribute values must be quoted


#"Valid" XML Documents#
A "well formed" XML document is not the same as a "valid" XML document.
A "valid" XML document must be well formed. In addition, it must conform to a document type definition.
There are two different document type definitions that can be used with XML:
	DTD - The original Document Type Definition
	XML Schema - An XML-based alternative to DTD
