With XSLT you can transform an XML document into HTML
01. Displaying XML with XSLT
	- XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is the recommended style sheet language for XML.
	- XSLT is far more sophisticated than CSS. With XSLT you can add/remove elements and attributes to or 
	from the output file. You can also rearrange and sort elements, perform tests and make decisions about which elements to hide and display, and a lot more.
	- XSLT uses XPath to find information in an XML document.
