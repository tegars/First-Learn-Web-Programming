XML files are plain text files just like HTML files.
XML can easily be stored and generated by a standard web server.

01. Storing XML Files on the Server
	XML files can be stored on an Internet server exactly the same way as HTML files.
	Start Windows Notepad and write the following lines:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<note>
	  <from>Jani</from>
	  <to>Tove</to>
	  <message>Remember me this weekend</message>
	</note>
	Save the file on your web server with a proper name like "note.xml".


02. Generating XML with PHP
	XML can be generated on a server without any installed XML software.
	To generate an XML response from the server using PHP, use following code:

	<?php
	header("Content-type: text/xml");
	echo "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>";
	echo "<note>";
	echo "<from>Jani</from>";
	echo "<to>Tove</to>";
	echo "<message>Remember me this weekend</message>";
	echo "</note>";
	?>
