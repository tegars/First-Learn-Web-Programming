#02 What is Multimedia?
	Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see
	Examples: Pictures, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more
	Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats



#03 Browser Support
	The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.
	Later came browsers with support for colors and fonts, and even support for pictures!
	The support for sounds, animations, and videos is handled differently by various browsers. Different types and formats are supported, and some formats require extra helper programs (plug-ins) to work.
	Hopefully this will become history. HTML5 multimedia promises an easier future for multimedia.
